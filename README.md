### Hey there I'm Marius Kimmina aka Mindslave

- I'm an IT-Security student and participate in CTF challenges every now and then.
- I'm currently learning about malware analysis and detection.
- I'm looking for an active CTF team to play and learn together.
- I'm also playing League of legends every once in a while.
- I'm trying to learn Korean (No I'm not into kpop, metal all the way)
